## Priorities

The Modern Standart Turkic language has 3 priorities:
	
	- intelligibility

	The main and perhaps the most important priority for M.S.T. is intelligibility. The language should be understandable for all (if not, most) Turkic speakers. This means that the language should be as close as possible to the Turkic languages spoken in the Turkic countries.
	While intelligibility is the most important priority, it is not the only one.

	- simplicity

	The language should be designed in a way that is both easy to learn and easy to teach. This might sometimes mean that the language is not as close to the historic Turkic languages as it could be, but it is a necessary trade-off to be made.

	- Historic Heritage

	The language should try to, when possible, be more accurate to the historic heritage of the Turkic languages. This means that the language should try to be as close as possible to the historic Turkic languages like Old Turkic, Chagatai, Old Uighur etc. This is the least important priority, but it is still important nevertheless.
