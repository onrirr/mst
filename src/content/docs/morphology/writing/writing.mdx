Modern Standart Turkic has two alphabets. One of them is based around the Orkhon Alphabet while the other is based around the Latin Alphabet.
While we can't say which is objectively "better" we can take time to consider our priorities.

- intelligibility
- simplicity
- Historic Heritage

The latin alphabet is more intelligible to the Turkic speakers of today, but the Orkhon Alphabet is more historically accurate. 
For someone who knows neither alphabet they are somewhat the same in terms of their simplicity (Orkhon is a bit better at being carved in stone.)

Observing this it would make sense to use the Latin alphabet for almost everything but the Orkhon variant will remain here incase someone wants to use it.
